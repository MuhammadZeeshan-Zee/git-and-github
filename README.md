Many things that we use, to make readme file well, first of All   
# 1.heading:  
To make heading we use # sumbol with one space and write the text that we want to include in your heading.
# 2.Paragraphs:
to make pragrahs we write text of paragraph as etis
# 3.Italic:
Wrap the item with One star/underscore on each side. for example    
*one star on each side*  
_This text is also italic_   
# 4.Line breaks
To insert a line break into your Markdown file, finish your line with at least two spaces and press Enter. It will render a new line for your text.
# 5.Bold
Wrap the item with Two stars/underscores on each side. for example  
**two stars on each side**  
__This text is also bold__    
# 6.Simultaneously Bold and Italic:
Make your text Simultaneously bold and italic to give it even more weight!  
Use three asterisks (or three underscores) to wrap your word or phrase.  
***This text is italic and bold.***  
___This text is also italic and bold.___  
# 7.Striking through: 
Wrap the item in two tildes on each side.  
~~strikethrough~~  
# 8.Links:
To link to external websites in Markdown content use two sets of brackets.  
Wrap link text in brackets [ ], and then wrap the URL in parentheses ( ): [ ]( ).  
[This text links to gfg](https://write.geeksforgeeks.org/).   
# 9. Images:
Inserting an image into your Markdown file is similar to the formatting for links.  
Begin your image formatting with an exclamation mark. Next, use square brackets to wrap your image alt text, next to parentheses containing the URL for your image.  
Ensure there are no spaces between the exclamation mark, square brackets, or parentheses.

# 10. Unordered lists:
Markdown allows you to format your lists with several different symbols: asterisks (*), hyphens (-), or plus signs (+).  
Itâ€™s up to you to choose which symbol you prefer. The result you get is the same.  
-Just add a dash first and then write a text.  

-If you add another dash in the following line, you will have another item in the list.  
    - If you add four spaces or use a tab key, you will create an indented list.  
        - If you need sert an indenta list within an intended one, just press a tab key again.  

Sometimes you want bullet points:  

*Start a line with a star   
*Profit!
